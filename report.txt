Q1 :

We cannot Do uniform hemispherical sampling and Cosine on Point and Directional Lights.
in point light case, we cannot get a random ray that passes through the light. the probability
is zero. we may get but the probability of getting is zero. Its not impossible. In case of Directional
Lights, the light will be at infinity. So for a ray to grasp that light, it should travel in that direction
only. and that has probability 0. It is also not impossible event but Chance of occurance is very rare.
so its better not to do hemispherical sampling on Point light and Directional Lights.

Q2 : 

when the area light area gets decreased then it means only some part of the hemisphere can have rays
that touches the area lights. in all the other cases rays donot intersect the area light at all. so we get
black spots more. thats why the image looks more noisy.
